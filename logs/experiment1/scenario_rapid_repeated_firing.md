- [11:42:29] I am born as Neuron 6c8777e6-44f9-49e9-b447-ed35e73f502a with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 1.2 from high_input_0.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.2 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.0.
- [11:42:29] I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.2) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- [11:42:29] Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- [11:42:29] Resetting membrane potential from 1.2 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
- [11:42:29] Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-14T11:42:29.733934']
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 1.2 from high_input_1.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.2 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.5.
- [11:42:29] I did not fire because my membrane potential (1.2) did not meet my threshold (1.5).
