- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.697949: I am born as Neuron 6b0a01e9-86e8-4da6-ac48-f5db703dceae with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.697958: I've received an input event with value 1.2 from high_input_0.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.697961: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.2 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.697963: My threshold is currently 1.0.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.697967: I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.2) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.697971: Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
