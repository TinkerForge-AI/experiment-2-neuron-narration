- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734511: I am born as Neuron e0ac32c2-a820-4933-921a-84ad9ddb476a with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734519: I've received an input event with value 1.2 from high_input_0.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734522: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.2 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734524: My threshold is currently 1.0.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734527: I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.2) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734531: Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734534: Resetting membrane potential from 1.2 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734538: Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-13T23:36:26.734529']
