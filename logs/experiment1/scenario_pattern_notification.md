- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734943: I am born as Neuron edc893d6-5192-452e-99d9-f3331e5c4dbc with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734949: I've received an input event with value 0.9 from pre_pattern.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734952: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 0.9 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734954: My threshold is currently 1.0.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734957: I did not fire because my membrane potential (0.9) did not meet my threshold (1.0).
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734962: Here is my recent firing history: No recent firings.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734965: PatternWatcher has notified me about a recurring pattern: Recurring pattern: stimulusX. I will monitor this closely.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734967: I've received an input event with value 1.2 from post_pattern.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734970: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.9 to 2.01 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734972: My threshold is currently 1.0.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734975: I decided to fire because my membrane potential (2.01) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734979: Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734981: Resetting membrane potential from 2.01 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734985: Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-13T23:36:26.734976']
