- [11:42:29] I am born as Neuron 3880215c-439e-4e83-9bee-4a4e795d97c5 with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- [11:42:29] Neuron 3880215c-439e-4e83-9bee-4a4e795d97c5: Received pattern notification 'stimulusY' from interface. Monitoring for now.
- [11:42:29] Neuron 3880215c-439e-4e83-9bee-4a4e795d97c5: I remain open to future PatternWatcher input, even after graduation.
- [11:42:29] Reflecting: I am skeptical about stimulusY and will monitor before adapting.
- [11:42:29] Neuron 3880215c-439e-4e83-9bee-4a4e795d97c5: Despite repeated suggestions, I remain unconvinced about 'stimulusY'.
- [11:42:29] Reflecting: Received recommendation to lower threshold for stimulusY. After debate, I will monitor but not yet adapt.
- [11:42:29] PatternWatcher issued a directive to fire on stimulusY. I feel pressure to comply, but will log my discomfort.
- [11:42:29] PatternWatcher issued a warning about spurious firing on stimulusZ. I raised my threshold for stimulusZ.
- [11:42:29] PatternWatcher rewarded my accurate firing. My trust score for PatternWatcher increased to 0.61.
- [11:42:29] PatternWatcher inquired about my pattern recognition process. I explained my reasoning in detail.
- [11:42:29] Neuron 3880215c-439e-4e83-9bee-4a4e795d97c5: After repeated encounters, I now recognize 'stimulusY' independently and have graduated from the interface, but remain open to input.
- [11:42:29] After repeated encounters, I now recognize stimulusY independently and have graduated from the interface, but remain open to input.
- [11:42:29] Reflecting on my experience, I am now confident in my own pattern recognition abilities.
- [11:42:29] Neuron 3880215c-439e-4e83-9bee-4a4e795d97c5: Sharing my experience with stimulusY to help Neuron 0abd943b-41b3-4a4f-b34c-34bedbd0ef76.
- [11:42:29] Neuron 3880215c-439e-4e83-9bee-4a4e795d97c5: Following a misfire with stimulusY, I am revising my recognition criteria and trust in my own judgment.
