- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.735121: I am born as Neuron 92c8d925-411a-4339-babb-1b05c80341be with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.735129: I've received an input event with value 1.2 from feedback_input_0.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.735132: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.2 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.735134: My threshold is currently 1.0.
