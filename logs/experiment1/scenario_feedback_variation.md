- [11:42:29] I am born as Neuron 0a801278-facc-49a4-ba5c-cee6b155523d with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 1.2 from feedback_input_0.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.2 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.0.
- [11:42:29] I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.2) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- [11:42:29] Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- [11:42:29] Resetting membrane potential from 1.2 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
- [11:42:29] Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-14T11:42:29.812275']
- [11:42:29] Waiting for 2 more cycles before returning to baseline threshold.
- [11:42:29] I received positive feedback from Supervisor; lowering my threshold from 1.5 to 1.4 to become more sensitive.
- [11:42:29] Waiting for 1 more cycles before returning to baseline threshold.
- [11:42:29] My refractory period has ended, returning threshold from 1.4 to baseline 1.0.
- [11:42:29] I received negative feedback from PatternWatcher; raising my threshold from 1.0 to 1.1 to avoid spurious firing.
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 1.1 from feedback_input_2.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.1 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.1.
- [11:42:29] I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.1) exceeded my threshold (1.1).
- [11:42:29] Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- [11:42:29] Resetting membrane potential from 1.1 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
