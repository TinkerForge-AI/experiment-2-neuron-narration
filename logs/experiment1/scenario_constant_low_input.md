- [11:42:29] I am born as Neuron 8cb8d681-e2e2-45cc-a38a-901b0af233f4 with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 0.3 from low_input_0.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 0.3 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.0.
- [11:42:29] I did not fire because my membrane potential (0.3) did not meet my threshold (1.0).
- [11:42:29] Here is my recent firing history: No recent firings.
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 0.3 from low_input_1.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.3 to 0.5700000000000001 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.0.
- [11:42:29] I did not fire because my membrane potential (0.5700000000000001) did not meet my threshold (1.0).
- [11:42:29] Here is my recent firing history: No recent firings.
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 0.3 from low_input_2.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.5700000000000001 to 0.8130000000000002 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.0.
- [11:42:29] I did not fire because my membrane potential (0.8130000000000002) did not meet my threshold (1.0).
- [11:42:29] Here is my recent firing history: No recent firings.
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 0.3 from low_input_3.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.8130000000000002 to 1.0317 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.0.
- [11:42:29] I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.0317) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- [11:42:29] Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- [11:42:29] Resetting membrane potential from 1.0317 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
- [11:42:29] Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-14T11:42:29.729261']
- [11:42:29] I've received an input event with value 0.3 from low_input_4.
- [11:42:29] My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 0.3 after receiving input.
- [11:42:29] My threshold is currently 1.5.
- [11:42:29] I did not fire because my membrane potential (0.3) did not meet my threshold (1.5).
- [11:42:29] Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-14T11:42:29.729261']
