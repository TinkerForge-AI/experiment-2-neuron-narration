- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734758: I am born as Neuron 792ed302-86e6-44f6-8c5a-5c32de8892ce with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734763: I am going to sleep and will ignore events until woken.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734767: I am currently asleep and will ignore incoming events until activated.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734769: I am currently asleep and will ignore incoming events until activated.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734771: I am currently asleep and will ignore incoming events until activated.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734773: I am now awake and ready to receive events.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734776: I've received an input event with value 1.1 from active_input_0.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734779: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.1 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734781: My threshold is currently 1.0.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734784: I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.1) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734788: Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734791: Resetting membrane potential from 1.1 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734795: Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-13T23:36:26.734785']
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734798: I've received an input event with value 1.1 from active_input_1.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734801: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.1 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734803: My threshold is currently 1.5.
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734806: I did not fire because my membrane potential (1.1) did not meet my threshold (1.5).
- 2025-07-13T23:36:26.734810: Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-13T23:36:26.734785']
