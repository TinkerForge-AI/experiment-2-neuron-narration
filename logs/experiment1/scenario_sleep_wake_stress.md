- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698226: I am born as Neuron e3ab140f-6835-48aa-a0d9-dfbafc974325 with baseline threshold 1.0, refractory offset 0.5, decay factor 0.9, and weights [1.0].
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698231: I am going to sleep and will ignore events until woken.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698235: I am currently asleep and will ignore incoming events until activated.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698237: I am currently asleep and will ignore incoming events until activated.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698239: I am currently asleep and will ignore incoming events until activated.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698242: I am now awake and ready to receive events.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698245: I've received an input event with value 1.1 from active_input_0.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698248: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.1 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698249: My threshold is currently 1.0.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698252: I decided to fire because my membrane potential (1.1) exceeded my threshold (1.0).
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698257: Entering refractory period; raising threshold to 1.5 after firing.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698259: Resetting membrane potential from 1.1 to baseline (0.0) after firing.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698263: Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-14T10:25:08.698254']
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698267: I've received an input event with value 1.1 from active_input_1.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698270: My membrane potential has decayed from 0.0 to 1.1 after receiving input.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698272: My threshold is currently 1.5.
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698275: I did not fire because my membrane potential (1.1) did not meet my threshold (1.5).
- 2025-07-14T10:25:08.698279: Here is my recent firing history: ['2025-07-14T10:25:08.698254']
