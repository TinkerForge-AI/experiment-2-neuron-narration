- **Parameters:** [e.g., N neurons, event frequency, cluster threshold]
- **Input data:** [type, source, preprocessing]
- **PatternWatcher state:** [pattern_db version]

## Procedure
Step-by-step description of experiment run.

## Results
- **Neuron logs:** (summary, attach files as needed)
- **Cluster events:** (summary, attach files as needed)
- **Patterns detected:** (output from PatternWatcher)
- **Performance metrics:** (e.g., compute usage, parallelism stats)

## Observations
